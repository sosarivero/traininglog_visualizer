# Training Log Visualizer

It is a very barebones project, but I decided to upload it already because I was starting to feel anxiety over not finishing the final project.

## Video Demo

## Description

A mini web-app powered by [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) that shows visualizations out of a chosen lift in a user-updated CSV file generated by the [Strong.app](https://www.strong.app/) workout tracker.

### Things learned to execute the project

* Setup of local development environment.
* Learnt some Python development best practices, such as use of virtual environments, use of pip, and importance of dependencies.
* Learnt basic usage of the Pandas module to handle data.
* Leanrt how to clean up some parts of the data (in this case, a CSV file) before being able to use it for analysis.
* Learnt basic usage of the Streamlit framework for quick creation and deployment of data dashboards.
* Learnt how to use Git and GitHub and some of their best practices for version coltrol and development.

### Update plans

This project is barely a mockup right now. I would like to add more features such as:

* Handling of CSV files generated by other popular workout tracker apps, such as FitNotes.
* Concurrent analysis of multiple lifts.
* Add more visualizations and display other data that might be of interest to powerlifting enthusiasts.

I can see myself updating this project more until the point that it might be worthwhile to share with a community of lifters.
